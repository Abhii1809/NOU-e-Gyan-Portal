# NOU-e-Gyan-Portal
I developed the e-NOU e-Gyan Portal using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Java with Spring Boot, and MySQL, featuring a responsive design, course management, user registration, exam tracking, and secure data storage.
It will resolve the academic issues such as Self-Learning Material distribution, delivery, tracking, assessment, progress monitoring & controlling of all stakeholders of the system i.e., students, teachers, study Centre administrators as well as university administrators when they are at distant.
